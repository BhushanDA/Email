# *Project Name*
Email Classification using Machine Learning and Deployment of model using Flask

# *Description*
•	Inappropriate emails would demotivates and spoil the positive environment that would lead to more attrition rate and low productivity. The goal of the project is to identify such emails in the given day based on the inappropriate contents.\
•	Initially I did EDA and preprocessing of text data provided in training set. Data is too unbalanced so SMOTE algorithm is used to balance the data. After that Support Vector Classification (SVC) algorithm is applied to that data to classify mails which includes Hyper-parameter tuning to increase accuracy. This project is implemented using Python and is deployed using Heroku.\
•	After implementation, model is classifying mails into abusive and non-abusive categories with 96% accuracy.
